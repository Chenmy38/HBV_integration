# HBV integration analysis
A ha! I have my github repository!

In this project I used the [SurVirus](https://github.com/kensung-lab/SurVirus) software to predict integration sites of WT-HBV or X-minus-HBV on the human genome. 

There are still some remaining questions about the usage of the SurVirus software. 

1. What does **maxSCDist** parameter means and how it affects the sensibility and accuracy of the algorithm?
2. What are differences among four results text files?
